# California Avenue
## Overview
This is a Real Estate web project that tries to incorporate a bit of almost everything I have about web development so far. It features full authentication and authorization, simple and clean styling, registration emails, Firebase integration, Google Cloud Functions and more.

### Major Technologies
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS

## Future Plans
- I would like to try scraping the URL provided in the dataset to get the actual images of the houses instead of using placeholders.
- Try to incorporate more animation
- Definitely improve responsiveness. This was designed for desktop screens, and I would like to go back and redesign from the ground up with a mobile-first approach
